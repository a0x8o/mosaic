Mosaic is an extension to the `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_ framework that allows easy and fast processing of very large geospatial datasets.

We currently recommend using Databricks Runtime with Photon enabled;
this will leverage the Databricks H3 expressions when using H3 grid system. 

Mosaic provides:

   * easy conversion between common spatial data encodings (WKT, WKB and GeoJSON);
   * constructors to easily generate new geometries from Spark native data types;
   * many of the OGC SQL standard :code:`ST_` functions implemented as Spark Expressions for transforming, aggregating and joining spatial datasets;
   * high performance through implementation of Spark code generation within the core Mosaic functions;
   * optimisations for performing point-in-polygon joins using an approach we co-developed with Ordnance Survey (`blog post <https://databricks.com/blog/2021/10/11/efficient-point-in-polygon-joins-via-pyspark-and-bng-geospatial-indexing.html>`_); and
   * the choice of a Scala, SQL and Python API.

.. note::
   For Mosaic versions < 0.4 please use the `0.3 docs <https://databrickslabs.github.io/mosaic/v0.3.x/index.html>`_.

.. warning::
   At times, it is useful to "hard refresh" pages to ensure your cached local version matches the latest live,
   more `here <https://www.howtogeek.com/672607/how-to-hard-refresh-your-web-browser-to-bypass-your-cache/>`_.

Version 0.4.x Series
====================

We recommend using Databricks Runtime versions 13.3 LTS with Photon enabled.

Mosaic 0.4.x series only supports DBR 13.x DBRs. If running on a different DBR it will throw an exception:

**DEPRECATION ERROR: Mosaic v0.4.x series only supports Databricks Runtime 13. You can specify
`%pip install 'databricks-mosaic<0.4,>=0.3'` for DBR < 13.**

Mosaic 0.4.x series issues an ERROR on standard, non-Photon clusters `ADB <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/runtime/>`_ |
`AWS <https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/index.html/>`_ |
`GCP <https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/runtime/index.html/>`_ :

**DEPRECATION ERROR: Please use a Databricks Photon-enabled Runtime for performance benefits or Runtime ML for spatial
AI benefits; Mosaic 0.4.x series restricts executing this cluster.**

As of Mosaic 0.4.0 (subject to change in follow-on releases)

   * `Assigned Clusters <https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#access-modes>`_ : Mosaic Python, SQL, R, and Scala APIs.
   * `Shared Access Clusters <https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/configure.html#access-modes>`_ : Mosaic Scala API (JVM) with
     Admin `allowlisting <https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/allowlist.html>`_ ;
     Python bindings to Mosaic Scala APIs are blocked by Py4J Security on Shared Access Clusters.

.. warning::
    Mosaic SQL expressions cannot yet be registered with `Unity Catalog <https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog>`_
    due to API changes affecting DBRs >= 13, more `here <https://docs.databricks.com/en/udf/index.html>`_.

.. note::
   As of Mosaic 0.4.0 (subject to change in follow-on releases)

   * `Unity Catalog <https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog>`_ : Enforces process isolation which is difficult to
      accomplish with custom JVM libraries; as such only built-in (aka platform provided) JVM APIs can be invoked from other
      supported languages in Shared Access Clusters.
   * `Volumes <https://docs.databricks.com/en/connect/unity-catalog/volumes.html>`_ : Along the same principle of isolation,
      clusters (both assigned and shared access) can read Volumes via relevant built-in readers and writers or via custom
      python calls which do not involve any custom JVM code.


Version 0.3.x Series
====================

We recommend using Databricks Runtime versions 12.2 LTS with Photon enabled.
For Mosaic versions < 0.4.0 please use the `0.3.x docs <https://databrickslabs.github.io/mosaic/v0.3.x/index.html>`_.

.. warning::
   Mosaic 0.3.x series does not support DBR 13.x DBRs.

As of the 0.3.11 release, Mosaic issues the following WARNING when initialized on a cluster that is neither Photon Runtime
nor Databricks Runtime ML `ADB <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/runtime/>`_ |
`AWS <https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/index.html/>`_ |
`GCP <https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/runtime/index.html/>`_ :

**DEPRECATION WARNING: Please use a Databricks Photon-enabled Runtime for performance benefits or Runtime ML for spatial
AI benefits; Mosaic will stop working on this cluster after v0.3.x.**

If you are receiving this warning in v0.3.11+, you will want to begin to plan for a supported runtime. The reason we are
making this change is that we are streamlining Mosaic internals to be more aligned with future product APIs which are
powered by Photon. Along this direction of change, Mosaic has standardized to JTS as its default and supported Vector
Geometry Provider.
